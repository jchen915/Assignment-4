# Assignment 4: Cohort Analysis

This project examines the relationship between smoking status, gender, and outcomes including cardiac events and healthcare expenditure using a simulated cohort dataset. Logistic regression is used to predict the probability of cardiac events, and linear regression models medical costs. The analysis includes interaction effects and presents results in both summary tables and visualization figures.
