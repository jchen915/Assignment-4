# Introduction

Cigarette smoking remains a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), contributing to conditions such as coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The [**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/cigarettes-and-cardiovascular-disease.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) reports that smoking is responsible for one in every four deaths from CVD in the United States. The pathophysiological mechanisms include endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and atherosclerosis, which collectively elevate the risk of cardiac events[@Ambrose2004].

Beyond its clinical implications, smoking imposes a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems. A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine estimated that by 2010, 8.7% of annual healthcare spending in the U.S. was attributable to cigarette smoking[@Xu2021; @Xu2015]. This financial strain underscores the importance of effective tobacco control measures.

The relationship between smoking and cardiac events is further complicated by demographic factors, notably age and gender. Research indicates that female smokers have a 25% higher risk of developing coronary heart disease compared to male smokers, even when accounting for similar levels of tobacco exposure[@Huxley2011]. Additionally, the risk of CVD increases with age, and smoking can exacerbate age-related cardiovascular deterioration[@Gallucci2020].

The current study utilizes a simulated cohort dataset to examine the association between cigarette smoking and cardiac events, with adjustments for age and gender. By analyzing both binary outcomes (presence of cardiac events) and continuous outcomes (healthcare costs), the study aims to elucidate the multifaceted impact of [**smoking on cardiovascular health**](https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/french-paradox-diet-food-france-f28c7pnnl?utm_source=chatgpt.com&region=global) and economic burden.

# Methods

A descriptive summary table was generated to compare participant characteristics by smoking status. Continuous variables (age and medical cost) are presented as means and standard deviations, and categorical variables (sex and cardiac events) are presented as frequencies and percentages.

Group differences were evaluated using independent two-sample t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for binary variables. P-values are reported in the rightmost column of the table. All summaries were produced using the `gtsummary` package in R.

We then fit two separate regression models to estimate the effect of smoking on two outcomes: cardiac events (binary) and medical cost (continuous). In both models, we adjust for age and gender.

The first model is a **logistic regression** for the binary outcome of adverse cardiac events:

$$
\text{Cardiac}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Smoking}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Female}_i + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Age}_i + \beta_4 \cdot (\text{Smoking}_i \times \text{Female}_i) + \varepsilon_i
$$

The second model is a **linear regression** for the continuous outcome of medical cost:

$$
\text{Cost}_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \cdot \text{Smoking}_i + \alpha_2 \cdot \text{Female}_i + \alpha_3 \cdot \text{Age}_i + \alpha_4 \cdot (\text{Smoking}_i \times \text{Female}_i) + \varepsilon_i
$$

In both equations: - $\text{Smoking}_i$ is a binary indicator for whether participant *i* is a smoker. - $\text{Female}_i$ is a binary indicator for sex (1 = female). - $\text{Age}_i$ is the age in years. - $\text{Smoking}_i \times \text{Female}_i$ is the interaction term - $\varepsilon_i$ is a random error term (in the linear model).

$\beta_1$ and $\alpha_1$ would be our targets of interest.
